# VeriFile - MetaMask Authentication Integration

VeriFile now features a modern, secure UI with MetaMask wallet authentication for both Organizations and Employees. This implementation provides a complete authentication flow that integrates seamlessly with the existing Self.xyz verification system.

## 🚀 New Features

### 🔐 MetaMask Authentication
- **Secure Wallet Connection**: Connect using MetaMask browser extension
- **Message Signing**: Cryptographic message signing for identity verification  
- **Dual User Types**: Separate interfaces for Organizations and Employees
- **Session Management**: Persistent authentication with automatic session restore

### 🎨 Modern UI Design
- **Clean Interface**: Professional, modern design with gradient backgrounds
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Clear user flows with helpful information modals
- **Loading States**: Smooth loading animations and progress indicators

### 📊 Dashboard Features

#### Organization Dashboard
- **Employee Management**: View and track employee verification status
- **Analytics**: Visual statistics for completed and pending verifications
- **QR Code Generation**: Integrated verification QR codes
- **Settings Panel**: Configurable verification requirements

#### Employee Dashboard  
- **Personal Profile**: Manage personal information and verification history
- **Document Upload**: Secure document management interface
- **Verification Tracking**: Monitor verification status and history
- **Identity Verification**: Complete Self.xyz verification process

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### Authentication Flow
1. **Wallet Connection**: User connects MetaMask wallet
2. **Message Generation**: System generates unique authentication message with timestamp and nonce
3. **Message Signing**: User signs message with their private key via MetaMask
4. **Data Collection**: System collects three essential pieces:
   - **Wallet Address**: Public 0x... address 
   - **Original Message**: Exact text that was signed
   - **Signature**: Cryptographic signature from MetaMask

### Integration with Self.xyz
The authentication data is automatically included in the Self.xyz verification process:

```typescript
const userDefinedData = {
  walletAddress: authData.address,
  signature: authData.signature, 
  originalMessage: authData.message,
  userType: userType,
  authenticatedAt: new Date().toISOString()
}
```

This data is passed to the Self.xyz QR code builder, ensuring that wallet authentication is part of the verification process.

### Security Features
- ✅ **No Transaction Authorization**: Signing is for authentication only
- ✅ **Private Key Security**: Private keys never leave the user's device
- ✅ **Session Management**: Secure session storage with expiration
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

## 📱 User Experience

### Landing Page
- Clean welcome interface with MetaMask installation check
- Clear explanation of authentication process
- Help modal with detailed information about how MetaMask signing works

### Authentication Process
1. User clicks "Connect with MetaMask"
2. MetaMask opens for wallet connection
3. User selects Organization or Employee type
4. System generates authentication message
5. MetaMask opens for message signing  
6. User is authenticated and redirected to appropriate dashboard

### Protected Routes
- Routes are protected based on authentication status and user type
- Automatic redirects for unauthorized access attempts
- Persistent authentication across browser sessions

## 🔧 Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: React Router v6
- **Wallet Integration**: ethers.js v6 + MetaMask
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom gradients
- **Verification**: Self.xyz integration
- **State Management**: React Context API

## 🚦 Getting Started

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Access Application**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`
   - Ensure MetaMask is installed and set up

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- **Message Uniqueness**: Each authentication message includes timestamp and nonce
- **Session Expiry**: Authentication sessions expire after 24 hours
- **Read-Only Access**: No transaction capabilities during authentication
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling for all MetaMask interactions

## 🎯 User Types & Permissions

### Organization Users
- Access to employee management dashboard
- Can generate verification QR codes
- View verification analytics and reports  
- Configure verification requirements
